## What is this?
This is basically a repository with links to Minecraft anticheats, along with information on them and how they function. I will also give an overall rating for each and decide what is the best one (in my opinion at least).

## Anti-Cheat Links
### Polar (Paid)
Polar is an anti-cheat that mitigates cheaters (as opposed to being a silent ac). It is pretty advanced overall. Here are some of the core features:

- Movement Prediction (Prevents almost all movement exploits)

- High Performance (Probably asynchronous and multithreaded, which prevents the anti-cheat from lowering TPS

- Cloud Based Checks (Correct me if Im wrong, but Im pretty sure Polar has cloud based checks)

Falses: I haven't seen it false flag me a lot, so for this I would give it a 8/10.

Bypasses: Not many clients bypass Polar well, and will mitigate quick with a bad config. However I've seen NoSlows and such in the past, 7/10.

Pricing: Polar is pretty expensive, so some may not be able to afford it. It is a monthly paid product, 5/10.

Overall: 8/10

### Intave (Paid)
Intave is another paid anti-cheat which is fairly advanced. It also mitigates cheaters like Polar. Here are some of the core features.

- Multithreaded (Intave is multithreaded to reduce server load on the main thread)

- Cloud Based Combat/Scaffold Checks (Similar to Polar, Intave has some cloud based checks)

Falses: Since I don't go on Intave servers a lot, I'll just say 7/10 for now.

Bypasses: Intave is a bit more bypassable, but have claimed to patch some backtracks, 6/10.

Pricing: Intave seems to be cheaper than Polar, 6/10.

Overall: 7/10

### AntiGamingChair (Private)
AntiGamingChair is a custom anti-cheat used specifically for MMC (minemen.club).

- Many Checks (AGC seems to have a lot of checks, ranging from autoclicker to aimassist, phase to fly, etc.)

Falses: Doesn't false most of the time, 9/10.

Bypasses: Has some bypasses like 250ms backtrack, and scaffold, 6/10.

Pricing: You either can't get it or have to pay a lot for a worse version, 3/10.

Overall: 7/10

Link: N/A
